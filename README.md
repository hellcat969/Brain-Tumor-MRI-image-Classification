# Brain Tumor MRI Classification 

This model is designed to predict tumors in Brain based on the CNN image classification and Optimization.


## Appendix

This dataset is gathered from the authorized personalities based on MRI imaging technology. This is very efficient as it's valued on Brain Tumors 3 different stages recognition. Mostly for the purpose of medical treatments. 

This repository conatins prediction model each of which is classified on value bases. This model is showing about 80% accuracy test of validation_testing process. And it makes it much preferable for all the purposes.
